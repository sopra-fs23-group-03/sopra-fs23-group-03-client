## Introduction
TODO:
lany- I will copy the final text in here when it is ready -lany

## Technologies
- React
- Google Cloud (doployment)

TODO: add more?

lany- I just looked up the stack on the assignmentsheet 1 ^^' for the backend I knew what of that to add, but here I'm not certain :p -lany

## High-level components

TODO:
Identify your project’s 3-5 main components. What is their role?
How are they correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text
with a link.

## Launch & Deployment
TODO:
Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?

lany- I put here what used to be in the README from the template. adapt what's necessary :) -lany

### Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesn’t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

### Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

#### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

#### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Learn More

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

> Thanks to Lucas Pelloni and Kyrill Hux for working on the template.

## Illustrations
TODO:
In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s) of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to include a few screenshots of your application.
